 *  - "with-coverage"  mask thinking the same way tool results are masked
 *                     (idx < cutoffIdx; respects the static-cutoff zone)
 *  - "above-cutoff"   mask any thinking block at idx < cutoffIdx without
 *                     the MIN_MASK_LENGTH gate; aggressive mode for
 *                     long-context models with `preserve_thinking` on

 *  long-context degrades past ~128K. Coverage slightly relaxed
 *  ([0.50, 0.75, 0.92]) because a 27B dense model is more sensitive to
 *  elided context than the 480B MoE the JetBrains paper measured.
 *
 *  effectiveContextCap = 131072: cap pressure math at half the
 *  advertised window. Lets a 262144-served model still compress
 *  aggressively enough to keep the working set inside the proven
 *  long-context regime.
 *
 *  Placeholder format kept as default `[cm-masked …]` so users opting
 *  into this profile don't get a prefix-format change as a side effect
 *  of switching profiles. The XML self-closing form is documented as a
 *  custom-profile recipe (see README) for users who want to A/B it.
 *
 *  maskOldThinking = "with-coverage": Qwen3.6 ships with
 *  `preserve_thinking` on, so historical `<think>` blocks accumulate in
 *  context. Masking them via the same coverage gate as tool results is
 *  the conservative middle ground — JetBrains-aligned but not as
